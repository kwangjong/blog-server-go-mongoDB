## What does REST stands for?
**`REST`** stands for **`REpresentational State Transfer`**. It refers to an industry-known architectural style that describes uniform interface between a client and a server. **`RESTFUL`** web services are services that uses Rest API to communicate. It is designed to take advantages of HTTP when used for web APIs.

## Benefits of Rest API
* **Uniform**: Rest API is standardized and industry-used style.
* **Stateless**: Rest API does not save and manages states. The API service simply process imcoming requests. This simplifies implementation by not managing unnecessary information on the server.
* **Cacheable**: Rest API uses HTTP cache semantics which allows cacheable responses to be stored on the client-side. This improves the performances of web services.

## Methods
* `POST`: **Create** new a resource.
* `GET`: **Read** or retrieve a resource.
* `PUT`/`PATCH`: **Update** or modify a resource. `PUT` handles an update by replacing entire entity, while `PATCH` only updates the field.
* `DELETE`: **Delete** a resource.

## Requesting Rest API

Rest API requests consist four parts: **header**, **operation**, **endpoint**, and **body**.
* **Header**: store information relevant to both client and server such as authentication data (key, name, ip address, ... etc) or content type
* **Operation**: the api method you want to call.
* **Endpoint**: contains url indicating where and how to find the resource.
* **Body**: parameters or additional information required for the request such as a piece of data you want to create or update.


## Example
Let's say that you work with a web service for a icecream shop that shows and updates flavors of icecreams that are in stock. The url of the web service is `http://icecream.com/api`. The following codes are psudo-representation of HTTP requests.


First, let's say you want to get flavers that are available.

`Request:`
```javascript
base_url = "http://icecream.com/api"

request(base_url, {
  headers: {"acess_token": "vDNof0S9Kf"}
  opper: "GET"
  endpoint: "/flavors"
  body: {}
});
```
`Response:`
```json
{
  {
    "id": 0,
    "flavorName": "strawberry"
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "flavorName": "mint chocolate"
  }
}
```

But then, mint chocolate flavor runs out and you want to delete mint chocolate from the database.

`Request:`
```javascript
base_url = "http://icecream.com/api"

request(base_url, {
  headers: {"acess_token": "vDNof0S9Kf"}
  opper: "DELETE"
  endpoint: "/flavors/1" // mint chocolate has id 1
  body: {}
});
```
`Response:`
```json
{}
```

Few hours later, a delivery truck arrives to the shop and stocks chocolate chip flavor. You adds chocolate chip flavor to the database.

`Request:`
```javascript
base_url = "http://icecream.com/api"

request(base_url, {
  headers: {"acess_token": "vDNof0S9Kf"}
  opper: "POST"
  endpoint: "/flavors"
  body: {
    "id": 2,
    "flavorName": "chocolate chip"
  }
});
```
`Response:`
```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "flavorName": "chocolate chip"
}
```
