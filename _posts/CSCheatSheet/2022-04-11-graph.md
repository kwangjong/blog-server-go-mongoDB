## Graph
A ***graph*** is an abstract data structure for representing connections among elements represented by vertices connected by edges.
* ***Vertex***: an element or a node in a graph.
* ***Edge***: a connection between two vertices.

### Adjacency and Paths
* ***Adjacency**: two vertices are **adjacent** if connected by an edge.
* ***Path***: sequence of edges leading from a source to destination. Its **length** is the total number of edges in the **path**.
* ***Distance***: the **distance** between two vertices is the **length of the shortest path** between the vertices.

### Graph Representation
Two common approaches for representing a graph are an ***adjacency list*** and an ***adjacency matrix***.
#### Adjacency List
In an **adjacency list**, each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices.

#### Adjacency Matrix
Each vertex is assigned to a matrix row and column, the matrix element is 1 if there is an edge between the corresponding row and column. the matrix element is 0 otherwise.

## Types of Graph
### Directed Graph
A kind of graph where an edge has a **direction**. In an **directed graph**, a vertex is **adjacent** to another if edges are going from the other vertex to itself, not the other way around.
* ***Path***: sequence of directed edges leading from the source to destination.
* ***Cycle***: a path that returns to the starting vertex. A graph containing a **cycle** is called ***cyclic graph***. If the graph does not contain a **cylic**, it is called ***acyclic graph***.

### Weighted Graph
In weighted graphs, each edge has a **weight** or **cost**. **The length of a path** is the sum of edges' weights in the path.

## Graph Traversal
Similar to tree traversals, there are two common orders of traversing a graph: **breath-first search** and **depth-first search**.
### Breath-First Search
From starting vertex, visit all vertices with distance 1, then visit all vertices with distance 2, and so on.

### Depth-First Search
**DFS** visits every vertex along each path from the starting vertex until the end of the path is reached. Then, backtracks and traverses all unvisited paths.
