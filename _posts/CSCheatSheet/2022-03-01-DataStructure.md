## Data Structure Basics
***Data Structure*** is a way of organizing data in a computer efficiently. Different data structures are used according to the purpose so that a computer can effectively load and store data.

***Abstract Data Type (ADT)*** is a data type described by pre-defined using user operation such as "insert data at the rear". ***ADT*** only provides what operations are defined, not how the operations are implemented. For example, ***Stack*** is a ***abstract data type***. ***Stack*** is defined by ***push()*** which inserts an element at the top of the stack and ***pop()*** which gets top-most element out of the stack.


## Array / List
***Array*** stores data in sequential order. Each element can be accessed using an ***index*** usually starting from 0.

![array](https://kwangjong.github.io/CSCheatSheet/img/array.png)

Time Complexity:
* Indexing: O(1)
* Search: O(n) / O(log n)


## Linked List
***Linked List*** is a series of entries that stores the value and a pointer to the next entry. Each entry is called ***Node***. Physical placement of the ***Nodes*** does not have to be sequential.

Time Complexity:
* Indexing: **O(n)**
* Append/Prepend: **O(1)**
* Delete: **O(n)**

***Singly Linked List***: each Node has only one pointer pointing to the next Node. Can only traverse in one direction.<br/>
***Doubly Linked List***: each Node has two pointers: one pointing to the next Node, another pointing to the previous Node. Can traverse in both directions.<br/>
***Circular Linked List***: "last" node of the list points to the "first" node of the list. Can traverse the list infinitely looping around the list.<br/>

## Stack
***Stack*** is an ADT that is described by Last-In-Fist-Out(LIFO) behavior. It can be implemented using both ***Array*** or ***Linked List***
* ***push()***: insert an element at the top of the stack
* ***pop()***: return and remove an element at the top of the stack

[Implementation](https://github.com/Kwangjong/CSCheatSheet/blob/main/implementation/stack.py)

## Queue
***Queue*** is an ADT that is described by First-In-First-Out(FIFO) behavior. It can be implemented using both ***Array*** or ***Linked List***
* ***enque()***: insert an element at the end of the queue
* ***deque()***: return and remove an element at the head of queue

[Implementation](https://github.com/Kwangjong/CSCheatSheet/blob/main/implementation/queue.py)


## HashTable / HashMap
***Hash table*** is a data structure that stores unordered items by mapping (or hashing) each item to a location in an array (or vector). It maps a unique ***key*** to an index using a ***hash function***. Each hash table array element is called ***bucket***. A common example of a ***hash function*** uses the modulo operator.

![hash-table](https://kwangjong.github.io/CSCheatSheet/img/hash-table.png)

Time Complexity:
* Indexing: **O(1)**
* Search: **O(1)**
* Insert: **O(1)**

***Collision handling***: Collision occurs when a ***hash function*** returns the same outputs for distinct keys.
* ***Chaining***: a technique where each bucket has a list of items.
* ***Open Addressing***: a technique where collisions are resolved by looking for an empty bucket elsewhere in the table.
  * ***Linear Probing***: handles collision by linearly searching the bucket starting from the key's mapped bucket.
  * ***Quadratic Probing***: handles collision by quadratically searches the bucket starting frolm the key's mapped bucket. <br/>
       f(i) = (H + c1 * i + c2 * i<sup>2</sup>) % (*tablesize*), where H is the inital bucket, c1 and c2 is a programmer-defined constants.
  * ***Double hashing***: uses two hash functions to compute bucket indices. f(i)=(h1(key) + h2(key) * i) % (tablesize).
Iterating through a sequential *i* values to obtain the desired table is called ***probing sequence***.


## Tree
***Tree*** is an ADT that simulates hiearchial structure by a set of linked nodes. Each Node stores its value and sets of its "child" nodes.

![tree](https://kwangjong.github.io/CSCheatSheet/img/tree-1.png)

* ***Parent and Child Node***: A link between the nodes in the tree are described with a parent-child relationship. If Node 'A' stores pointers to the Node 'B'. Node 'A' is a parent of Node 'B', and Node 'B' is a child of Node 'A'.
* ***Root***: A node with no parent. There can be only one root node in a tree.
* ***Leaf***: a tree node with no children.
* ***Internal node***: a node with at least one child.

![tree](https://kwangjong.github.io/CSCheatSheet/img/tree-2.png)

* ***Edge***: a link from a node to a child
* ***Depth***: the number of edges from the root to the node
* ***Level***: all nodes with the same depth
* ***Height***: the largest depth of any node.

### Binary Tree
In ***Binary Tree***, each node can only have up to two child nodes (*left and right child*).
* A binary tree is ***full*** if every node contains 0 or 2 child nodes.
* A binary tree is ***complete*** if all level, except the last level, are full and all node in the last level are as far left as possible.
* A binary tree is ***perfect*** if all internal node have 2 child nodes and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

### Binary Search Tree
***Binary Search Tree*** is a special type if a binary tree that has an ordering property. All the keys of any nodes's left subtree are less than the node's key, and all the keys of any node's right subtree are greater than the node's key. This property can make searching a key in the tree fast.

Time complexity:
* Insert: **O(h)**, where h is height of BST.
* Delete: **O(h)**
* Searching: **O(h)**
